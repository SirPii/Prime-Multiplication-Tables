How to run:

1. Open up the html file with any browser (Tested on IE, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox)
2. Open up the console of the browser by pressing the key F12 and clicking on the console tab at the bottom
3. To run the code, click on the button called "Click Me"
4. Enter the desired amount of prime numbers (Works best with up to 15 numbers)
5. Watch as the code displays the multiplication table of the prime numbers in the console output.

I am very pleased with the project as I was given multiple assignments at University and I was able to time manage all of them
while still producing high quality work. I had little experience with HTML before and none with JavaScript so I was also pleased
with the outcome as I was able to pick up a new language and create the project. 

If I had more time I would change the way the numbers get generated so that they would get generated based on how many numbers
the user wanted instead of picking them out of an array. I would also try and change the output to the HTML website instead of
the console as the webpage has a lot more space to handle a bigger multiplication table. I would also change the way I alligned
the multiplication table as I could not figure out a less manual way of doing so.
